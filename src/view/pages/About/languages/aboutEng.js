      Project X means love, it's trust and cohesion.
      Everything that belongs to a family. Jamie-Ann Nzuba Lang
      is 23 years old and has been living in Germany since she was born.
      Her environment has always been close to her heart, which is why
      participating in the human rights movement BLM and the resulting silent
      demonstrations in Stuttgart was not a question. What was depressing for Ja_y_,
      however, was the unimportant reporting by the Stuttgart press and news services
      regarding our demands and wishes during the demo. 'They don't want to listen to us, they HAVE to
      listen to us'. Since then, Jamie-Ann has been working on a concept that is mainly based on the support of
      young Stuttgart artists. A platform in which we can generate a voice and hopefully demonstrate our
      seriousness in various trades in order to gain hearing, reach and profit in the future.
      We don't just want to set an example for this moment, we want to start a movement of self-confidence,
      self-love and self-reflection. We want long-lasting tolerance and respect! We are no longer selling below value,
      we are now a team! The video 'Project X by Ja_y_', starting with the idea of a video in which we
      inspire people of all ages, origins and sexuality to find out about culture and history independently.
      We want to show that it is enriching to live in a city full of different influences. It is important to
      recognize that we always benefit from it when our environment is doing well! Together with incredible artists
      (dancers, models, musicians, designers, cameramen ...) we achieved incredible feedback and an enormous reach during
      our first 3 shootings! (Impressions in the appendix). Publication of the entire video is still open.
      The aim of the whole project is to generate as much attention as possible around us so that we cannot be
      overheard! In the video area, the aspects of history, culture and education are very important, we want to
      inspire you to be interested in and research about its history, origin and culture. We want to remind you that
      the beautiful world we love today is so endearing because of its differences and inequalities. We wanted to bring
      young artists together to prove with this project that no money is needed to do good, but also to create a platform
      for our artists to exchange and inspire. What is 'I don’t talk, I dooo ...' It’s about a talk show that is a little
      bit more than what we knew before. Ladies and gentlemen, I cordially invite you to 'I don’t talk, i doo ...'. With great guests,
      speakers and of course our musicians, we will talk about history, development and experiences from Stuttgart, how we deal with
      intolerance and what each of us can do to make the planet a more comfortable place for everyone. A show moderated by Ja_y_ and
      made possible by our generous sponsors of B&B Eventtechnik. With great guests like the guys from Red Lektion, Toni Dreher, the
      organizers of the Silent Demo Stuttgart etc. Our talk show (broadcast on August 9th, 2020 at 7:30 p.m.) has the focus of teaching
      we want people to be interested in them the video has been packed, have a chance to learn more about what it is about and what exactly
      can be done. We invited great guests who tell us something about the history of black people, the social development of the relationships
      between black and white people and the current problems that come with it and what solutions there are for a nicer together.
      What is Black is Beautiful? Black is Beautiful is a photo exhibition that is part of Project X by Ja_y_ and focuses on Stuttgart's
      black people and their beautiful existence. Amina Ousman is the mother and creator of this fabulous idea. The exhibition is the crowning
      glory for Project X. Amina Ousman is also working on the photo book which will be made available for purchase on the day of the exhibition.
      Our photo exhibition (time is still open) is to go back to Stuttgart's black individuals, we want to show people in their everyday life in
      Stuttgart how they live, what they work and what they find beautiful. The results of the video shoot are also part of the exhibition.
      We are supported by organizations such as Karakara - Help for Children in Niger e.V., DAFRIG and others. In addition, we will set up stands and art,
      jewelry, etc. Exhibit for sale. The proceeds will of course be donated to organizations selected by us.
